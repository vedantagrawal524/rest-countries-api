# üåç Where in the World? ‚Äî REST Countries API App

This is a solution to the [REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca). It helped me improve my skills in **React**, **dark/light theme implementation**, and **working with REST APIs** to build a dynamic UI.
